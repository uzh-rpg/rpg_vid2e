# esim\_torch

This package exposes python bindings for ESIM with GPU support. 
Test your installation with 

```bash
cd esim_torch/
python test.py
```

which should create a plot. 

The currently supported functions are listed in the example below:
```python
import esim_torch

# constructor
esim = esim_torch.EventSimulator_torch(
    contrast_threshold_neg,  # contrast threshold for negative events
    contrast_threshold_pos,  # contrast threshold for positive events
    refractory_period_ns     # refractory period in nanoseconds
)

# event generation
events = esim.forward(
    log_images,        # torch tensor with type float32, shape T x H x W
    timestamps_ns  # torch tensor with type int64,   shape T 
)

# Reset the internal state of the simulator
events.reset()

# events can also be generated in a for loop 
# to keep memory requirements low
for log_image, timestamp_ns in zip(log_images, timestamps_ns):
    sub_events = esim.forward(log_image, timestamp_ns)

    # for the first image, no events are generated, so this needs to be skipped
    if sub_events is None:
        continue

    # do something with the events
    some_function(sub_events)

```
