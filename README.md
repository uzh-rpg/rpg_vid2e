This repository contains code that implements 
video to events conversion as described in Gehrig et al. CVPR'20 and the used dataset. The paper can be found [here](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/CVPR20_Gehrig.pdf)

## News
We now also release new python bindings for esim with GPU support.
Details are [here](esim_torch/README.md)

## Dataset
The synthetic N-Caltech101 dataset, as well as video sequences used for event conversion can be found [here](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/data/VID2E/ncaltech_syn_images.zip). For each sample of each class it contains events in the form `class/image_%04d.npz` and images in the form `class/image_%05d/images/image_%05d.png`, as well as the corresponding timestamps of the images in `class/image_%04d/timestamps.txt`.

## Installation
Clone the repo *recursively with submodules*

```bash
git clone git@github.com:uzh-rpg/rpg_vid2e.git --recursive
```

## Installation with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
Adapt the CUDA toolkit version according to your setup. 

```bash
cuda_version=10.1

conda create -y -n vid2e python=3.7
conda activate vid2e
conda install -y pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=$cuda_version -c pytorch
conda install -y -c conda-forge opencv tqdm scikit-video eigen boost boost-cpp pybind11
```

Build the python bindings for ESIM

```bash
pip install esim_py
```

Build the python bindings with GPU support with 

```bash
pip install esim_torch/
```

## Adaptive Upsampling
*This package provides code for adaptive upsampling with frame interpolation based on [Super-SloMo](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~hzjiang/projects/superslomo/)*

Consult the [README](upsampling/README.md) for detailed instructions and examples.

## esim\_py
*This package exposes python bindings for [ESIM](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/CORL18_Rebecq.pdf) which can be used within a training loop.*

For detailed instructions and example consult the [README](esim_py/README.md)

## esim\_torch
*This package exposes python bindings for [ESIM](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/CORL18_Rebecq.pdf) with GPU support.*

For detailed instructions and example consult the [README](esim_torch/README.md)
